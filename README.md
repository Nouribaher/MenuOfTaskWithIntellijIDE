In the first step, we should have to  know the path of files and start the application with the  Test's Run command.
```bash
 test run 
```
#### Test.Java 
This class is part of the TodoList app. As there are some lists that help the user to choose one of the tasks, 
and then the data will be sent to other classs and recorded in the class file to be saved, updated and reviewed at any time.
## Usage
```JAVA
import mport java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
        Task task = new Task("Nouri","1978-10-03","ITC","Maher");
        ArrayList<Task> taskArrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        taskArrayList.add(task);
        fileHandler.WriteAsData(taskArrayList);
